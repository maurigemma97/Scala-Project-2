# Scala-Project-2

Task 1: 
In this task the code generates a random list of 40 shape objects, then traverses the list from the start to the end, and computes the total area of the shape objects. 

Task 2: 
-This program takes a webpage url (say x) from the user, and then down-load the webpage x. Program counts the number of images and scripts.
-Program counts how many pages have more than 2 images.

Task 3a:
function foo which takes a list of strings as input. For each string s in 1, foo uses the higher order function map to compute the reverse of string s. Finally, foo return a new list containing these reverse strings.

Task 3b:
Function foo which takes a list l of integers as input.Then, foo uses foldLeft to compute the sum of squares of all elements l. Finally, foo returns the computed sum.
